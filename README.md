📊 Project 1: Patient Health Risk Analysis (Python )
🔹 Project Overview
This project analyzes patient health data to identify individuals who are at risk of heart disease and other medical conditions using Python and data visualization tools.
🔹 Tools Used
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Matplotlib)
•	Power BI
•	Excel (for initial data handling)
🔹 What I Did
•	Cleaned missing and inconsistent data using Pandas
•	Created new features like:
•	Age Group categorization
•	BMI Category
•	Lifestyle Risk Score
•	Metabolic Risk Score
•	Cardiac Risk Score
•	Used data visualization to understand:
•	Risk distribution by age
•	BMI vs Cholesterol impact
•	High-risk patient identification
•	Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to display:
•	Risk trends
•	High-risk patient segments
•	Health metrics comparison
🔹 Key Insights
•	Patients above 50 with high cholesterol and high BP show higher cardiac risk.
•	Smoking and obesity significantly increase health risk.
•	Early identification helps in preventive care.
🔹 Outcome
•	This project demonstrates how data analytics can help in early risk detection and healthcare decision-making.

📱 Project 2: Social Media Data Analysis (Python )

🔹 Project Overview
•	This project analyzes social media data to understand user engagement, content performance, and audience behavior.
🔹 Tools Used
•	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)
•	Power BI
•	Excel
🔹 What I Did
•	Cleaned and processed raw social media dataset
•	Handled missing values and duplicates
•	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
•	Analyzed:
•	Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
•	Most active posting time
•	Best performing content type
•	Platform-wise comparison
🔹 Key Insights
•	Certain content types generate higher engagement.
•	Posting at peak hours increases reach.
•	Engagement patterns differ by platform.
🔹 Outcome
•	This project helps businesses understand:
•  What type of content performs best
•  When to post
•  How to improve engagement strategy


•	What type of content performs best
